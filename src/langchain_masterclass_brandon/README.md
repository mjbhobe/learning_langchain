# Langchain_Brandon
Langchain Tutorial from AI with Brandon. Instead of `poetry`, we are using `conda` to manage our environment.

## Setup
1. Start your terminal on Windows or Mac or Linux, wherever you are coding and set your working folder to a folder to which you will clone the Github repo of this code (Let's assume your working folder is c:\code or ~/code - I'll use the term $WORKING_FOLDER for this folder)
2. Clone the github repo for this code to  $WORKING_FOLDER using the following command, this will create a sub-folder `Langchain_Brandon` under $WORKING_FOLDER.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mjbhobe/Langchain_Brandon.git
```
(Github repo: https://github.com/mjbhobe/Langchain_Brandon.git).
